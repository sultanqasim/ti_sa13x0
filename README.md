# Texas Instruments SA13x0

The SA1350 Project implements an RF spectrum analyzer based on the TI CC13x0
SimpleLink RF SOC. The SA1350 is capable of performing RF measurements over
three frequency bands: 2152MHz to 2635MHz, 861MHz to 1054MHz, and 431MHz to 527MHz.
RF measurement parameters can be adjusted through user input and RF measurement
results viewable in a spectrum plot from within a graphical user interface (GUI).
